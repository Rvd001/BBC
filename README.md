# BBC
This is a dataset by BBC and I intend to know the common topic among the articles in different categories.

## Questions:
1.	For each of the five categories: what are the most common topics among articles?
2.	Across all categories: how many articles talk about each of the G20 countries?
a.	Note that we are in interested in topics about the country, so a mention of the UK might be an article on British business even if it doesn’t mention the words “United Kingdom”.

3.	Describe the methodologies you used to solve questions 1 and 2.
4.	What tools did you use for this analysis?
5.	How much time did you devote to this exercise?
6.	If you had more time how would you strengthen your answer for question 2?
